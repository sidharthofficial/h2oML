My learnings on the h2o library for AutoML using Python

Here we will learn about Automatic Machine Learning AutoML with H2O. 
H2O AutoML can be used for automating the machine learning workflow, which includes automatic training and tuning of many models within a user-specified time-limit. 
H2O automl provides easy way to run multiple models and can get the top ones along with the  hyperparameter. 

A classification project with banking data has been executed here.
